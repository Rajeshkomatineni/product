Q1. We have an online store with items organized in categories, sub-categories, and
sub-sub-categories up to N levels. Draw the database structure for the online store
with the category tree to store things. Each category has a name. The number and
level of categories can go up to infinite.
Write a query to fetch all the first-level children (categories+items) for a category.
Write a query to fetch all the children (categories+items) at all category levels for a
category.
Q2. Write the REST API endpoints for products consisting of (id, name, price) where
the price is in dollars.
The products now consist of (id, name, price, currency).
Define how will you apply this change, considering that
-API is in production.
-Other clients are using the existing API.
If you choose to version the API, write at a high level how the change will affect
controllers, services, entities, etc.
